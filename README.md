# code-refactor

## objective

given a functioning website, update the HTML and CSS sheet to reflect current best practices in element tags and accessability.

### conclusion

I updated the HTML's element tags from primarily being div tags into preferred semantic alternatives. I also added alt text for images and adjusted the CSS stylesheet to suit.
